</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Art Blocks has an application form that generative artists can submit. Please note that we are becoming increasingly selective, only accepting around 2% of projects submitted for release.</p>
<p>You can find out an application here: <a href="https://www.artblocks.io/apply">artblocks.io/apply</a></p>
<p>You will receive a project shell on our staging site when you apply. This project shell is where you will upload your project to Art Blocks for review. Only the wallet address connected to Art Blocks will have access to the project shell when applying. The shell creation ensures that all projects are compatible with Art Blocks and reviewed using a standard format.</p>

<p>When you&#x27;re ready to proceed to our screening stage, please email <a href="mailto:apply@artblocks.io">apply@artblocks.io</a> with a link to your staging shell.
Before the screening, ensure the work has a project description that explains the work&#x27;s technical, aesthetic, and conceptual approaches. Prototypes should have 40-50 mints, as well as feature traits. Also include an artist profile and links to any ancillary material about the work on the project page. All prototypes should be completely finished before review. The team will let you know when the work will be screened and give you a timeline for the acceptance decision.</p>

<p>Once you apply, you will have access to a staging shell on testnet. There, you can upload your generative script and mint test outputs. Prototypes should have 40-50 mints, a project description, and feature traits. Also include an artist profile and links to any ancillary material about the work on the project page. When you&#x27;re ready to proceed to our screening stage, please email <a href="mailto:apply@artblocks.io">apply@artblocks.io</a> with a link to your staging shell. All prototypes should be completely finished before review. The Art Blocks team will give you a timeline as to when the project will be reviewed and when you will be  notified whether or not your project is selected for an Art Blocks launch. Please note, we are becoming increasingly selective, only accepting 2% of projects submitted for release. Take your time in the artistic process to ensure you are bringing forth your best work.</p>

        <span>What is the MinterSuite, and how does it work?</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The MinterSuite allows artists to set specific minting contracts on a per-project basis. The MinterSuite currently includes the following minter options, which will continue to be expanded over time:</p>
<p><strong>Set Price - ETH</strong> is used for fixed price releases.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Exponential Dutch Auction</strong>: For exponential Dutch auctions, artists specify the starting price, ending price, and the half-life for price drops.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Linear Dutch Auction:</strong> For linear Dutch auctions, artists will specify the starting price, ending price, starting time, and ending time of the auction. The price will then gradually decrease each block over the total auction time.</p>
<p><strong>Set price in custom ERC20:</strong> Set price in ERC20 is a fixed price for your sale with a custom token. Artists will specify the address for the custom token sale.</p>
<p><strong>Set Price - ETH, Allowlisted Users Only (V1)</strong> these are addresses that are allowed to mint as many times as they want until they reach the mint limit (artists sets mint/wallet)</p>
<p>To find out how to set your project price using the MinterSuite visit <a href="https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/creator-onboarding/readme/project-form-fields-guide/#minter">this page</a>.</p>

<p>All Art Blocks work is completely on-chain. Artists must upload their technically-compatible project scripts to their staging shell to produce a collection. All projects must use the limited dependencies outlined in our Creator Documentation: <a href="https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/creator-onboarding/readme/#limited-dependencies">https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/creator-onboarding/readme/#limited-dependencies</a></p>

<p>Your script must be the same version of the <a href="https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/creator-onboarding/readme/#limited-dependencies">limited dependencies</a> accepted by the platform.</p>

<p>Randomness becomes deterministic when it&#x27;s seeded, which is what&#x27;s happening with the Art Blocks token data and suggested Random class. Once initialized, all calls to the random_dec method must remain consistent.  Resolving anything random before starting to draw is handy in that regard, plus you&#x27;ll also need to provide that code for the calculateFeatures function.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re getting inconsistent outputs, the first thing would be to ensure there&#x27;s no any forgotten Math.random() in your code and that your token data looks okay.</p>

        <span>My artwork depends on some deterministic Random function calls, and features depend on it. In the staging environment, the features script is completely separated from the artwork script. How can I calculate the features?

<p>You will rewrite the random calls in the feature script in the same order they are called in the artwork script. More info here: <a href="https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/creator-onboarding/readme/features/">https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/creator-onboarding/readme/features/</a></p>

        <span>I set up the features, types, and options in my staging shell, and copied my original code into the <code v-pre>Calculate Features</code> section, removed all the p5.js drawing, then set it up to build key-value pairs.

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>You should have the function return the dictionary with the features iirc, using the syntax <code v-pre>return {object name}</code>. If the problem still occurs, clear your cache. There may also be an authentication issue, so log out and log back into your wallet.</p>

<p>Once a project is accepted for release, it will take approximately 1-2 months to finalize your project on testnet, submit it for curation review, upload the script on mainnet, schedule a launch date, and finally release the project. The length of each step differs and depends somewhat on how quickly you, the artist, finalize your scripts.

<p>The Curated Collection is a group of projects that pushes the boundaries of Generative Art. A project in the Curated Collection covers new territory using code that employs inventive, never-before-seen techniques to support an original intention and concept. Board members look for collections that evoke emotional, intellectual, and conceptual qualities through aesthetics while sustaining the viewer’s interest.</p>

<p>Not at this time. Currently, everything must be included in the script file. For small and critical assets, you may be able to use <code v-pre>base-64</code> encoding to encode the asset into your script, but that will count as data to be stored.</p>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>If your script is big, consider minifying it. There are no limits to the total script length. That said, scripts that are larger than 24 kilobytes will need to be broken up into segments of 24kb. Segments can be added using the &quot;add script segment&quot; button when uploading a script. Be aware that you will have to pay transaction gas fees proportional to the size of the script upload.</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>As an artist, you should be aware of recent changes in royalty rate determination at OpenSea and Blur, which have resulted in a range of royalty payment percentages (from 0% to 5%). Due to this change, we&#x27;ve had to adjust our royalty payout calculations.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve chosen to uphold the same royalty split ratio between our Artists and Art Blocks (2/3 for the Artist and 1/3 for Art Blocks). Art Blocks handles the distribution of royalty payments received from marketplaces that do not offer direct splits through the Royalty Registry, following an internal review of secondary sales transactions.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding this updated split methodology or information regarding royalty payouts, please post in #artist-general on Discord.</p>

        <span>How can I customize revenue splits?</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Setting up revenue splits can be done through the <a href="https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/creator-onboarding/readme/project-form-fields-guide/#payout">Payout</a> fields in your project form. You can use the additional payee field within the form directly to send a portion of the revenue to that account. Many artists use this to make a charitable donation. To split revenue with more than one account, we recommend using <a href="https://www.0xsplits.xyz/">0xSplits</a>. Instructions on how to create a Split can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_uqQJghNAo">here</a>. Once your Split is created, paste the address into the additional payee field.</p>

        <span>What is Art Blocks&#x27; commitment to charitable giving?</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>To maintain our commitment to charitable giving, we ask artists to consider donating 25% of sales above the resting price via Dutch auction to a charity of their choice. If you elect to participate in this way, please determine your chosen charity, and confirm its eligibility, before mint #0. To whom and how you donate is entirely up to you. Art Blocks does not require you to donate any proceeds in order to engage with our platform. If you do elect to donate to a charity, it is advisable to consider whether the charity which you choose to support qualifies under United States tax law to receive tax-deductible donations. If your project designates only one primary wallet, you may use the additional payee field to manage on-chain donations. All revenue may also be routed to a single wallet and donated after your drop. We encourage you to consult with a tax professional to understand any potential tax implications of your planned giving, as these can be widely variable.</p>

        <span>Where can I find a list of charities that accept crypto donations?</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>To find a list of charities, you can ask for advice in #artist-general and check the pinned messages for a charity guide.</p>
<p>If the charity you’d like to donate to is not set up to receive crypto donations, we recommend checking out endaoment.org or CryptoForCharity.io. They both enable on-chain donations to any US-based 501c(3). Endaoment uses a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) model and has a 1.5% fee; CryptoForCharity sends the gifts on as they&#x27;re made and is zero fee. This method can also be done fully on-chain, so the donations go directly to the charity, as opposed to going through the project’s designated primary wallet. Please note: different methods of distribution can have different tax implications, and Art Blocks advises every artist to consult with a tax professional when making these plans..</p>

        <span>How can I donate to charity?</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Here are a few donation options:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>On-chain donations through Endaoment.org</strong></p>
<p>Endaoment is a 501(c)(3) organization that accepts crypto and distributes donations to any US-based 501(c)(3) charity in good standing with the IRS. Donations through Endaoment are set at the contract level and automatically routed at the time of payment without touching your wallet (potentially avoiding tax liability/deductibility).</p>
<p>To use Endaoment, go to <a href="https://endaoment.org">Endaoment.org</a>, connect your wallet and create a fund. Then, enter your fund&#x27;s contract address (shown on your newly created fund page) in the additional payee field. If using the additional payee field for donations, this field can be cleared before lowering to resting price. Many artists prefer this route so they can support multiple charities with smaller donations rather than a single charity with one large donation, but you can also set up organization as additional payee directly. In this case, go to <a href="https://endaoment.org/explore">Endaoment.org</a>, use their search bar to locate the org in question, and copy the contract address directly from the organization&#x27;s profile page to the payee field (you can do this for multiple charities if desired). If the organization(s) shows as &#x27;Not Deployed&#x27;, simply click &#x27;Deploy&#x27; to create a smart contract for that nonprofit. When that process completes, a contract address will populate on the organization&#x27;s profile page. After the mint concludes, contact Dan (Druid#4611 on Discord) with your fund’s URL or smart contract address. Endaoment will then process contributed ETH into USDC, allowing you to send donations in any amount to any charity in the US using their UI. Please note - Endaoment charges 1.5% to receive, convert, and distribute money to nonprofits.</p>
<p>You can also find a tutorial of how to use Endaoment <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/822350f1a1c84f25b253cc9e4d2cee38">here</a>, can find direct support in their Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/endaoment">here</a> by creating a ticket in the #🙋｜get․help channel, and can read up on their documentation <a href="https://docs.endaoment.org">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Make a zero-fee on-chain donation with CryptoforCharity.io</strong></p>
<p>CryptoForCharity is a zero-fee platform enabling donations in crypto assets directly to charity. You can support any US-based 501(c)(3) charity in good standing with the IRS, or donate to any of several cause funds focused on a specific issue.</p>
<p>Donations through CryptoForCharity are set at the contract level and automatically routed at the time of payment without touching your wallet (and potentially avoiding tax liability or the need to account for and deduct the income/donation). Donated funds can also be held for a short time following your drop, if you&#x27;d prefer to designate the charity or cause fund you wish to support after the fact, but they cannot be held indefinitely.</p>
<p>Generating a charity or cause fund wallet is straightforward -- simply fill out the form <a href="https://www.cryptoforcharity.io/nft-creators">here</a>. You can also reach out directly to SimonSays#0670 in the AB discord for help.</p>
<p>For a bit more on how it&#x27;s set up under the hood, <a href="https://www.cryptoforcharity.io/nft-creators">CryptoForCharity put together this tax guidance for NFT creators</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Create a second wallet</strong></p>
<p>If you’d like to create a second wallet separate from your personal wallet, you can enter the wallet&#x27;s address in the additional payee field to collect the total donation amount you intend to donate. If using the additional payee field for donations, this field can be cleared before lowering to resting price.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> <strong>Receive funds in your primary wallet</strong></p>
<p>If you’d like to receive all funds from your project’s sale in your primary wallet, that’s fine, but please communicate the total donations with Art Blocks and the community. Please be aware that receiving money in your personal wallet may incur tax obligations and reduce the total donation amount.</p>

<p>All artists are added to the artist-exclusive #artist-general channel in Discord, where you can interact with other Art Blocks artists, share projects, and ask questions. We encourage artists to participate in our Discord community. In addition, Art Blocks hosts a weekly <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y192a2RxdWluZ3ZsM2EyMmJudWxxZnFkb2sxOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t">Office Hours</a>. This dedicated time is the place for artists to chat synchronously, meet the Art Blocks team, participate in artist development-focused programming, and group critiques. If your project has been chosen for an Art Blocks Curated release, we will establish a dedicated artist’s  Discord channel for you  to centralize discussions of that project. For all artists releasing on Art Blocks, , the #block-talk channel is a great place to interact with fellow artists, collectors, and community members.</p>

<p>When an artist’s project is 100% minted (i.e. “complete”), the artist is eligible to submit a new project for screening. Please note: there is a six month “cool-off” period after a Curated project is complete before the artist may submit another project for consideration as Curated..</p>

<p>Yes. Please note, as of Aug 2, 2022, Art Blocks switched testing networks from Ropsten to Goerli.</p>
<p>If you previously had a testnet shell on the Ropsten network, you may still access your project shell using <a href="https://ropsten-artist-staging.artblocks.io/">https://ropsten-artist-staging.artblocks.io/</a> as a read-only set of data.

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>After your project is completed, you will be eligible to submit a new project for screening consideration. You will continue to have access to your testnet shell. New projects can be submitted for review either via a working prototype or via your existing testnet shell, to which you will continue to have access. To submit a new project for screening by sending a message to your Artist DM.</p>
<p>The first screening determines if a work is accepted onto the platform. A committee made up of Art Blocks&#x27; staff and generative art experts conducts this screening. This review focuses on overall aesthetics, mint variety, and the degree to which a project explores new territory technically, visually, and conceptually. Returning artists are still subject to the highly-selective screening process.</p>
<p>If the work is accepted to be released on Art Blocks you will then move through the same onboarding process as your previous project, which is also outlined <a href="https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/creator-onboarding/readme/artist-onboarding-steps/#5-feedback-check">here</a>.</p>
