# Welcome to the Art Blocks Docs!

This documentation seeks to provide guidance for 3 primary audiences: 

1) artists/creators preparing their projects to launch on Art Blocks or a Powered by Art Blocks (PBAB) platform
2) current and prospective PBAB partners
3) integrators/aggregators/marketplaces etc., looking to integrate with the Art Blocks APIs

You will find the three main sections in our documentation mirrors these three primary audiences. Please explore the docs here, and let us know if you have any questions.

For any issues with the docs, please file a bug [here](https://github.com/ArtBlocks/artblocks-docs/issues), or send us a PR with a suggested change!
