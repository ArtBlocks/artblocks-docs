Below, you'll find an overview of each step of our onboarding process, as well as an **, estimated** time required for each step.

## 1. Application

For the time being, applications will remain open. You may apply using this [link](https://www.artblocks.io/apply). We expect that artists have a creative history and the ability to provide an original generative script. If you plan to work collaboratively, please provide complete information for all contributors. All submitted work must be original. We do not intend to release projects that use licensed, purchased, or recycled content. Please make sure you‚Äôre bringing your unique project to Art Blocks. If you‚Äôve applied after October 28, 2022, you‚Äôll be given a staging shell to deploy your script on testnet.

To learn more about the application process please visit [artblocks.io/apply](artblocks.io/apply).

!!!info Timeline
Due to high volume, applications may take up to several months to process. We appreciate your patience every step of the way. Please understand that Art Blocks operates using a mentorship model, providing hands-on assistance and guidance while managing hundreds of artists in our pipeline.

## 2. Upload to testnet

You'll be asked to upload your project to the artist staging site on the Goerli test network. Here you can mint test outputs of your project and work out any kinks in your script before the Art Blocks selection committee reviews it. 

Please mint 40-50 test mints to produce a wide variety before review. At this stage, the creative components of your project should be almost completely finalized and appear the way you would want them to for the official launch. In addition, you will also want to provide a project description and include your features script. To confirm you‚Äôve included everything in your staging shell, refer to the [Testnet Checklist] (testnet-checklist.md). Required fields are marked in testnet with a ‚ÄúüìÑ: fields required for artist screening‚Äù indication. As you are uploading to testnet, you only need to fill in fields with this indication. 


Please note that all Art Blocks team members are working within US time zones, which means that there may be a delay in processing requests.

## 3. Script test runs and project review

Once you‚Äôve reached your spot in the queue, Art Blocks Art Team will reach out via email to confirm you‚Äôre ready to move on to the first screening. 

The first screening determines if a work is accepted onto the platform. A committee made up of Art Blocks' staff and generative art experts conducts this screening. This review focuses on overall aesthetics, mint variety, and the degree to which a project explores new territory technically, visually, and conceptually. With the high quantity and quality of submissions, Art Blocks is highly selective and can accept only roughly 15% of applications.

If your project is selected, you'll move into the Creator Terms step. If it is not selected, you'll receive brief feedback and be invited to apply again with a different project. 

Note: This stage does not determine if your project will be a Curated release.

[!badge Timeline: 2-4 weeks]

## 4. Creator terms

Our team will send you Art Blocks' Creator Terms via email to sign. These documents include Creator Terms and a W-9 or W-8 form that is necessary for Art Blocks to pay you artist royalties.  In addition, you will be asked to complete an Artist Information Form to collate your artist bio, recent exhibitions, projects, and press. You can move forward once we have received the proper paperwork. 

[!badge Timeline: Artist dependent. Typically 1-2 days]

## 5. Feedback check

Once accepted projects have been screened, the artist will be connected with our Artistic Director to provide 1:1 feedback. You will have the opportunity to incorporate this feedback before the Curation review. It may take up to a week before receiving feedback. 

[!badge Timeline: 7-10 days]

## 6. Curation review

After you have incorporated the feedback and made any last minute edits to your script or project description, your project will be considered for designation as Curated. Our Curation Board reviews your project and test mints and determines whether it's approved for an Art Blocks Curated release. Curators are looking at your shell and assessing it based on aesthetics, concept, technical quality, and innovation. After making their decision, the Curation Board will provide detailed feedback, which can be incorporated before your release (either as Curated, if it has been chosen, or as Presents, if it has not been chosen).  For more information about the Curation Board, their voting metrics, and the difference between Art Blocks Presents and Art Blocks Curated, please see our [FAQs](faqs.md). 

[!badge Timeline: 7-10 days]

## 7. Finalize your script and do QA testing 

After you‚Äôve received notes from the Curation Board and made final edits to your project, our team will audit your script. Art Blocks‚Äô audit ensures the project meets the technical requirements of the platform. During the audit, your project will be checked for security concerns and consistency across different resolutions and aspect ratios will be verified. Your script can be minified for the audit.

[!badge Timeline: 5-7 days]

## 8. Finalizations and upload to mainnet

Once the audit is complete, you'll move on to the mainnet finalization stage and get your project ready for launch, as either Curated or Presents. 

[!badge Timeline: Artist-dependent, but most artists spend about 1 week on this step]

## 8. Finalize project logistics and schedule project launch

Lock in series size, price mechanics (Dutch Auction, Linear Auction, or Fixed Price), launch date, and charity component for your project. For more information about price mechanics and the charity component, please see our [FAQs](faqs.md). Art Blocks releases three projects weekly; due to the number of artists in our pipeline, there is often a 2-6 week runway for release. After you have scheduled your project for release, you may begin promoting the project. For tips on marketing, please see our [Marketing 101](marketing-101.md). After your project is scheduled, you must complete our Cover Pages, an official record of the agreed terms. You must complete the document to receive royalty payments. 

[!badge Timeline: 1-2 days]

## 8b. Artist Interview [Curated projects only]

Complete an interview with the Art Team to be published the week of your project launch. This interview will highlight your background, creative history, and Art Blocks project.

[!badge Timeline: dependant on release runway]

## 9. Project Launch

Congratulations, you have made it! Your project is ready to be unpaused and opened for minting. You can participate in an optional live Pre-Drop Talk on Twitter with one of our Community Team members to answer questions and chat with the community.

[!badge Timeline: typically ~4-6 weeks after the completion of Step 8]

## 10. Post-Launch 

After you‚Äôve released your project, you will be asked to fill out an Art Blocks Feedback Survey. In addition to your feedback, we will inquire about your interest in being considered for commissions, partnerships, contract work, and more with our Art Blocks Engine partners. Please also report charitable donations to your mainnet DM. 

You may also personalize your collection layout on OpenSea. Learn how to do so [here](https://docs.artblocks.io/creator-docs/creator-onboarding/readme/opensea-personalization/)

Post-launch, you will still have access to your shell, where you can start uploading a new project at your leisure. Once your project has been 100% minted, you may submit another project for review.
