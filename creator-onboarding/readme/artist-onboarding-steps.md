# Artist Onboarding Steps

Below you'll find an overview of each step of our onboarding process as well as an **estimated** time required for each step.

## 1. Application

During one of our open application periods, submit a prototype of a proposed project along with your contact information and creative history. Our team will review each submission and reach out to you to get an updated version of your working prototype when it's your turn in the queue.

Due to the surge in Art Blocks popularity, applications may take up to several months to process. Applications will be reviewed in the order they were submitted.

## 2. Script test runs and project review

Our Creative Team will ask you for an updated version of your project if available and will screen your application and working prototype. Based on this, we will  decide whether to move forward with a launch on Art Blocks.

If your project is selected, you'll move into the Creator Terms step. If it is not selected, you'll receive brief feedback and be invited to apply again during our next application cycle.

Note: This stage does not determine if your project will be a Curated or Factory release.

[!badge Timeline: 1-2 weeks]

## 3. Creator terms

Our team will send you Art Blocks' Creator Terms via email to sign.

[!badge Timeline: 1-2 days]

## 4. Upload to testnet

Once the terms are signed, you'll be asked to upload your project to the artist staging site on the Ropsten test network. Here you can mint test outputs of your project and work out any kinks in your script before review by the curation board.

We encourage you to mint 40-50 test mints to produce a wide variety before curatorial review. At this stage the creative components of your project should be almost completely finalized and appear the way you would want them to for the official launch.

[!badge Timeline: Artist-dependent, but most artists spend about 1 week on this step]

## 5. Curation review

Our Curation Board reviews your project and test mints and determines whether it's approved for an Art Blocks Curated release. If not, you'll be able to launch your project as a regular deployment on Art Blocks Factory. For more information about the differences between the two, please see our [FAQs](faqs.md).

[!badge Timeline: 7-10 days]

## 6. Finalizations and upload to mainnet

Whether your project is Curated or Factory, you'll move on to the mainnet finalization stage and get your project ready for launch. Here you can make any final minor tweaks before uploading your project to mainnet.

## 7. Finalize project logistics and schedule project launch

Lock in series size, price mechanics (dutch auction or fixed price), launch date, and charity component for your project.

[!badge Timeline: 1-2 days]

## 7b. Artist interview [Curated projects only]

Complete an interview with Jeff Davis, our Chief Creative Officer, to be published before your project launch. This interview will highlight your background, creative history, and your Art Blocks project.

[!badge Timeline: 1 day]

## 8. Project launch

Congratulations, you have made it! Your project is ready to be unpaused and opened for minting.

You can participate in an optional live pre-launch talk with one of our team members to answer questions and chat with the community.

Once your project is 100% minted, you'll move into our cooldown period (2 months between Factory and Playground projects and 6 months between Curated projects), which is the amount of time we require between new project submissions.

[!badge Timeline: typically \~2 weeks after the completion of step 7]
