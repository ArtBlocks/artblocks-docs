# Community Agreements 

These community guidelines have been inspired by BUFU By Us For Us, Flatbush Mixtape, Binch Press (BP), and Queer.Archive.Work (QAW)  Community Agreements. 

The aim of having community agreements is to provide a space that is welcoming, comfortable, inspiring, and beneficial for all. Using such practices and tools we can challenge ourselves and each other while still recognizing that we all contribute unique knowledge and experience, while hopefully creating a positive impact on our community/ies.

We respect the diversity of identities including gender, pronouns, race, nationality, immigrant status, religious background, disability status, work experiences, and other vibrant multi-faceted aspects of who we are. We honor each other's boundaries and communicate with care. Withhold unsolicited advice, and assumptions about other participants, and agree to disagree. Comment only from your own perspective, don’t interrupt others, and be mindful to allow time for others to speak. Please feel empowered to move up to take up more space, if that’s not your tendency. Move back to allow others to speak who might not be as hard, and listen with respect. 

This is a consent-forward space, virtually and in-person. We commit to being accountable to one another. We strive to make our spaces safe and inclusive. If anyone is feeling disrespected or unsafe at any time, we hope you feel comfortable speaking directly with a member of Art Block’s team who is present to support our community’s comfort in this space. And to that end, we acknowledge these guidelines are a work in progress and welcome your suggestions and feedback.
