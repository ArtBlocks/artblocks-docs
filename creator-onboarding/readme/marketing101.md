# Marketing 101 
Marketing can help projects reach their widest audiences. Crypto markets are volatile, and sales are not guaranteed. One way artists achieve sustainable success can be to build an active and engaged audience. Art Blocks has a thriving community on several social media channels that is enthusiastic to engage with new artists and new projects. We encourage you to engage with this community and provide resources for doing so, as you prepare to release your work.

## Guidelines 
We ask that all artists DO NOT announce their Art Blocks affiliation until they’ve completed Mint #0 and have been provided a confirmed release date by the Art Team. You can use this time to share progress on your project and to connect with community members on Discord. 

Artists whose projects have been designated for Curated release must wait to announce the project and its Curated designation until after Art Blocks has made  an official announcement. 

## Art Blocks Promotion Resources

### Art Blocks Presents Releases

Twitter: Every Monday, we tweet links to the upcoming week’s events and releases.
Newsletter: Art Blocks announces upcoming releases on Tuesday via our newsletter, The Link.
Discord: The following week's releases are announced in #upcoming-projects on Discord at the end of each week.

### Curated Releases
Curated releases are included in the weekly Twitter roundup, newsletter, and #upcoming-projects announcement. Curated releases are also announced by the Art Team with a global ping in #community-announcements (typically) on the Thursday before their release. In addition, the Art Team will publish an interview with the artist. Curated artists will have their own dedicated Discord channel on the Art Blocks server to engage with community members.

### Art Blocks Community Programming
The Art Blocks community team hosts a series of public programs to help facilitate  conversation around generative art and its contexts, upcoming projects, and the creative coding process. All Art Blocks artists are invited to participate in these programs. If you are interested in joining, please message your artist DM to be connected with our Community Team. 

**Pre-Drop Talk**
Pre-Drop Talks happen on Twitter Spaces 15 minutes prior to the release of your project. A member of the Community Team will ask you a series of questions to help collectors get to know more about your creative process and the decisions behind your project. Pre-drop talks are announced on Twitter a few days before release, and you’ll be connected with the host of your talk after your project is announced in #upcoming-projects. You will receive interview questions in advance of the live show. If you do not have a Twitter account, the Community Team will explore alternative ways to host this conversation with you.

## Marketing Tools for Artists

One benefit of releasing on Art Blocks is that you are now entering a vibrant ecosystem of generative art experts and enthusiasts. Our main piece of advice for promoting your work/artist profile is to participate in the community. If you have been selected to release on our platform, your work is strong and valuable, no matter the curatorial status. 

### Art Blocks Discord Server

**#artist-general, #artist-tech, #artist-project-feedback**
Once you’ve been accepted to release on Art Blocks, you’ll be assigned an Artist role in Discord. Here’s your chance to tap into a community of artists preparing for their first release or have already released on Art Blocks! Building your audience begins with leveraging connections with your peers. This is a space to talk shop, ask technical questions, give feedback, and make friends. Build relationships here that extend outside the channel and into other spaces, both AFK (away from the keyboard) and online. Tweeted about your upcoming release? Ask fellow Art Blocks artists to engage with your content. Collaborate on boosting each other’s visibility. Social media can be emotionally taxing, so use this channel as a space to build supportive and genuine relationships. On Tuesdays at 11 PM CT/12 PM ET, Art Blocks hosts Office Hours on Google Meet. This meeting is an open invitation to chat with other artists and the Art Blocks team face-to-face (or audio-to-audio). With our communities spread worldwide, it can be difficult to connect. Through this standing meeting, we hope to bring artists together and strengthen our artist community. Add this meeting to your calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y192a2RxdWluZ3ZsM2EyMmJudWxxZnFkb2sxOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t). 

**#artist-announcements**
Once your project is scheduled, you can use this channel to make an announcement for our larger discord audience. This is an opportunity to narrate the story behind your work. If you have created any additional content, like a Medium article or Youtube video, this would be the place to share. 

**#block-talk**
Block Talk is the water cooler for Art Blocks collectors. Our community team does its best to keep a good vibe, but as with any high-speed internet forum filled with many passionate contributors, the conversations can become negative. That being said, bearing in mind your mental health and capacity, it’s the prime location to get your name out there. Hanging out in Block Talk is like being in the kitchen at a big party. Jump in and participate in the conversation. Have some thoughts about the color and composition of a recent project? This would be the place to voice that. Participation is key. Not only do community members respond well to artist input on this channel, but it’s also a great way to build name recognition. This is also the place you’ll want to lurk during your drop; here, you can elucidate and respond to collectors in real-time. 

**#block-talk // #curated-artist**
#block-talk is the designated area for collector discussions about Presents projects. Artists can use this space to announce their releases and make updates about their projects to collectors. This is especially useful for upcoming exhibitions, updates on physical shipments, and other pertinent information regarding a specific drop. 

Curated artists will have their own channels. Artists can use this space to announce their releases and directly engage with collectors.  


**Twitter**
Web3 trends towards Twitter and Discord. In addition to participating on the Art Blocks Discord Server, Twitter is a great place to promote your project. Again, our main piece of advice is to participate! Tweet, reply, and share works in progress. Engage with those who comment on your posts. Follow other generative artists and Web3 thought-leaders. Alongside Discord, this is the place to start conversations with fellow artists and collectors. Sharing your work is equally as important as participating in conversations. 

**Other Tips**
- Collaborate with an institution or gallery to showcase your work
- Have a virtual hype-man? Gift them with a token! Show appreciation to your fans 
- Create additional materials that frame and give context to your work as an artist, this can be done through a project website, Youtube video, Medium article, etc.


# Mental Health & Social Media 
*As told by Natalie Christensen*

## Tips for managing social media use:
For anyone who is considering reducing time on social media, it is a good idea to find out how much time you are spending there. There are apps that will help you get a baseline of how much time you are spending before setting a goal of reducing that time. 

[This article](https://wethegeek.com/best-apps-to-track-limit-social-media-usage/) from March 2022 recommends the best apps for tracking and reducing time on  social media. 

### Make a routine that works for you: 
After determining how much time you are spending on social media, start to pay close  attention to the emotions you feel when scrolling through a social media feed. If the emotions  are negative (FOMO, anxiety, jealousy, anger, or depression) it may not be the best place for you.  Consider removing the apps that bring up this feeling most. Choose an activity that can replace social media at that time – taking a walk, reading a book, breathing exercises, calling a friend,  etc. can be a remedy for these negative emotions.  

For those of us who need to use social media for work, promoting art, etc. it can help to set  specific times of day and a specific amount of time to attend to social media responsibilities and  then set it aside for the day. Set daily limits and stick to it. That may not be easily done but keep setting it as a goal until you  accomplish the daily time limits. Move on to other tasks after the time you allotted for social  media is complete.  
Consider turning off social media notifications so your phone is not distracting you from other  tasks.  

### Other things to consider: 
Sharing parts of your personal story on social media can be risky and uncomfortable. If you  choose to share, do it safely and manage expectations. Tell other friends you will be doing this  and ask for feedback before sharing. Ask for their support in the social media space if possible.  

Using social media one hour or less before bedtime can interfere with sleep, the quality of  sleep, etc. Consider keeping your phone in a place away from your bedside. Carefully consider the accounts you follow and consider their purpose and why you think it is important to follow them. If you don’t have a clear answer, consider unfollowing. 

Avoid online arguments or engaging with users you perceive to be negative: 
If you post a controversial opinion, don’t engage if you are attacked or negatively confronted.  Your social media is your own space and defending your work or beliefs constantly is  emotionally depleting. If someone tries to pull you into an argument, remember that kindness is  much more effective than anger.  

### Remember the benefits of life offline: 
Remember why you set the goal of less time online. If it was due to negative emotions  or too little time for other things, then that is a reason to continue working towards your goal.  Limiting time improves sleep and prioritizing in-person connections also reduces negative emotions and comparisons to others.
