# Charitable Donation Information

To maintain our commitment to charitable giving, we ask artists to consider donating a portion of artist proceeds to an eligible charity of their choice. To whom and how you donate is up to you but you should consider whether the charity or the cause you are donating to qualifies under United States tax laws as a charity/cause that is qualified to receive tax-deductible donations. We highly recommend consulting with a tax professional to understand your local tax liability, especially if you plan to personally receive all funds before donating. Below answers a number of common questions about how to donate and where to find crypto-friendly charities.

## Where can I find a list of charities that accept crypto donations?

To find a list of charities, you can ask for advice in #artist-general and check the pinned messages for a charity guide.

If the charity youâ€™d like to donate to is not crypto-friendly, we recommend checking out endaoment.org. They are a 501(c)(3) that enables on-chain donations to any US-based 501(c)(3) via a Donor Advised Fund (DAF). This method can also be done fully on-chain, so the donations never touch your personal wallet.

## How can I donate to charity?

Here are a few donation options:

**1)** **On-chain donations through Endaoment.org**

Endaoment is a 501(c)(3) organization that accepts crypto and distributes donations to any US-based 501(c)(3) charity in good standing with the IRS. Donations through Endaoment are set at the contract level and automatically routed at the time of payment without touching your wallet (potentially avoiding tax liability/deductibility).

To use Endaoment, go to [Endaoment.org](https://endaoment.org), connect your wallet and create a fund. Then, enter your fund's contract address (shown on your newly created fund page) in the additional payee field. If using the additional payee field for donations, this field can be cleared before lowering to resting price. Many artists prefer this route so they can support multiple charities with smaller donations rather than a single charity with one large donation, but you can also set up organization as additional payee directly. In this case, go to [Endaoment.org](https://endaoment.org/explore), use their search bar to locate the org in question, and copy the contract address directly from the organization's profile page to the payee field (you can do this for multiple charities if desired). If the organization(s) shows as 'Not Deployed', simply click 'Deploy' to create a smart contract for that nonprofit. When that process completes, a contract address will populate on the organization's profile page. After the mint concludes, contact Dan (Druid#4611 on Discord) with your fundâ€™s URL or smart contract address. Endaoment will then process contributed ETH into USDC, allowing you to send donations in any amount to any charity in the US using their UI. Please note - Endaoment charges 1.5% to receive, convert, and distribute money to nonprofits.

You can also find a tutorial of how to use Endaoment [here](https://www.loom.com/share/822350f1a1c84f25b253cc9e4d2cee38), can find direct support in their Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/endaoment) by creating a ticket in the #ðŸ™‹ï½œgetâ€¤help channel, and can read up on their documentation [here](https://docs.endaoment.org).

**2)** **Make a zero-fee on-chain donation with CryptoforCharity.io**

CryptoForCharity is a zero-fee platform enabling donations in crypto assets directly to charity. You can support any US-based 501(c)(3) charity in good standing with the IRS, or donate to any of several cause funds focused on a specific issue.

Donations through CryptoForCharity are set at the contract level and automatically routed at the time of payment without touching your wallet (and potentially avoiding tax liability or the need to account for and deduct the income/donation). Donated funds can also be held for a short time following your drop, if you'd prefer to designate the charity or cause fund you wish to support after the fact, but they cannot be held indefinitely.

Generating a charity or cause fund wallet is straightforward -- simply fill out the form [here](https://www.cryptoforcharity.io/nft-creators).

**3)** **Create a second wallet**

If youâ€™d like to create a second wallet separate from your personal wallet, you can enter the wallet's address in the additional payee field to collect the total donation amount you intend to donate. If using the additional payee field for donations, this field can be cleared before lowering to resting price.

**4)** **Receive funds in your primary wallet**

If youâ€™d like to receive all funds from your projectâ€™s sale in your primary wallet, thatâ€™s fine, but please communicate the total donations with Art Blocks and the community. Please be aware that receiving money in your personal wallet may incur tax obligations and reduce the total donation amount.

## How do I remove charitable giving information from the additional payee field mid-Dutch Auction?

If charity information is entered as an additional payee field and you would like to remove this information prior to decreasing your tier below 0.25 ETH, please adjust the additional payee field to either 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 or to your own wallet address and adjust the additional payee percentage to 0% before submitting the next price tier. These fields cannot be blank once the dutch auction has begun.
