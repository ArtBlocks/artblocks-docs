## What are the current PBAB offerings?

For a new partnership, the standard current PBAB offerings include:

   * `GenArt721CoreV2` contract: main PBAB contract
   * `GenArt721Minter` contract: minting contract, which supports minting in ETH and ERC20 tokens–can be upgraded in the future
   * `Randomizer` contract: basic randomizer, which provides additional entropy to the core contract for token creation–can be upgraded in the future.
2. Integration of deployed Core contract with decentralized Graph indexing architecture, on Ropsten and on mainnet (includes GRT costs incurred for subgraph update deployment).
3. Integration of deployed contracts and subgraph with Art Blocks’ project setup site, and with Art Blocks’ rendering and metadata infrastructure, on Ropsten and mainnet. API’s provided will include:
