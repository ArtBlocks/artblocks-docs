# Engine Partner Onboarding Steps

An overview of the steps required to onboard as an Art Blocks Engine partner.

## 1. Initial outreach

Interested in using Art Blocks Engine to launch a generative content platform? 

Reach out to **info@artblocks.io** to get started. We'll discuss your needs, explain what we offer in a partnership, and align expectations.

[!badge Timeline: typically 1-2 weeks]

## 2. Project scope

The Art Blocks team will work with you to determine the scope of the Art Blocks Engine project.

[!badge Timeline: 1-2 weeks]

## 3. Contract agreement

Once the project objectives and scope are agreed upon, you'll work with our operations team to sign our partnership agreement.

[!badge Timeline: 1 week]

## 4. Smart contract details

To get started, you'll provide our team with:

1. **An Ethereum wallet address** that you own and will use to manage your Art Blocks Engine smart contracts.
2. **The name you’ll use for tokens** from your contract (e.g., for Art Blocks, it is "Art Blocks")
3. **The ticker symbol you’ll use for tokens** from your contract (e.g., for Art Blocks, it is "BLOCKS")

Note: We cannot deploy your contract until you provide the above information. **The name and symbol tied to your contract cannot change once it’s set.**_

[!badge Timeline: 1-2 days]

## 5. Contract configuration & testnet deployment

We will configure your smart contract before transferring ownership to Ethereum address provided in Step 4. Once we deploy your contract on the test network, you can start testing your generative script. 

[!badge Timeline: 1 week]

## 6. Testnet infrastructure integration

Art Blocks will integrate your contracts with our rendering infrastructure and provide access to our staging website for you to perform project onboarding and configuration via the Art Blocks site on the test network.

[!badge Timeline: 1 week]

## 7. Integration with partner’s site

Your team will integrate your site’s front-end with the contract created by Art Blocks to test your outputs on the testnet.

[!badge Timeline: Varies (dependent on partner)]

## 8. Test mints on partner site

Your team ensures the minting process is working on the test network by minting your NFTs using the front-end of your site.

[!badge Timeline: Varies (dependent on partner)]

## 9. Deployment to mainnet

Art Blocks deploys the mainnet version of your contract and integrates it with our infrastructure.

[!badge Timeline: 1-2 weeks]

## 10. Infrastructure integration (mainnet)

Your team integrates the mainnet contract with your site and prepares to generate your first NFT (mint #0)

[!badge Timeline: Varies (dependent on partner)]

## 11. Mint #0

You can mint your project's first official token via your site!

## 12. Project launch

You can choose a launch date for your project. Please allow at least one week between a successful mint #0 and a go-live date.
