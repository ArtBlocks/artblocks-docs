Please explore the docs here, and let us know if you have any questions.","For any issues with the docs, please file a bug here, or send us a PR with a suggested change!"]}],[{"l":"Art Blocks 101 for Creators","p":["A guide on getting started as a creator with Art Blocks.","The primary audience for this document is artists who have already entered the pipeline for launching a project on Art Blocks. If you are an artist currently waiting in the applications queue or applying to Art Blocks, this documentation will provide a helpful guide for you in terms of what to expect, but many of the steps here will not be actionable for you until you have had a project shell set up by the Art Blocks team.","Artists will likely need to tweak/optimize their project code to get it working in the Art Blocks environment. Specifically, static images are rendered for all projects (used as thumbnails, on other platforms, etc.). To generate these, Art Blocks currently uses compute instances running headless Chromium with Puppeteer. Headless Chromium requires the use of SwiftShader, a CPU implementation of the GPU API. This means GPU intensive projects will render slower and may require code optimization and performance improvements from the artist. To closely replicate this environment on your end while developing, we recommend using Chrome and turning off\"Use Hardware Acceleration\" in Settings."]},{"l":"Documentation","p":["The Art Blocks platform hosts generative projects for the production of verifiably deterministic outputs. A generative script (using p5js for example) is stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain for each project. When a user wants to purchase an iteration of a project hosted on the platform, they purchase an ERC721 compliant \"non-fungible\" token, also stored on the Ethereum blockchain, containing a provably unique \"seed\" which controls variables in the generative script. These variables, in turn, control the way the output looks and operates.","Each \"seed\", also known as a \"hash string\" is a hexadecimal string generated in a pseudo-random manner at the time the token is minted. Each character (0-9, a-f) represents a value from 0-15 and each pair of characters (\"aa\", or \"f2\") represents a value from 0-255.","For example:","This hash will be the source of entropy or variation use to determine the output of your algorithm. When your art is rendered on Art Blocks, your script will have access to a global variable called tokenData. One of the first lines in your script should be to read in the hash from this variable.","Included in the tokenData is also the tokenId. The tokenId encodes both the project and mint.","Please note: if you include using the tokenId as a way to determine the outputs of your script you must disclose this as part of the release communications for your project.","If your script needs to know the mint number or project number, it can do so like this:","When you are testing locally, this variable obviously will not be defined in your browser environment. This here is a simple function to generate valid hashes and tokenIds."]},{"l":"Safely deriving randomness from the token hash","p":["Art Blocks requires that all artists use an instance of the following Random class to feed all of their project's randomness. If you need to modify/customize the Random class, please flag this to our team during the review process.","Note that the class uses the prng algorithm sfc32, which was designed and coded by Chris Doty-Humphry and is public domain. More information can be found at http://pracrand.sourceforge.net.","The convenience methods random_num, random_int, random_bool, and random_choice may be removed if not needed for a specific project. Artists may also add their own convenience methods, but all randomness should be originally sourced from the random_dec() function.","We can get an instance of the Random class like so:","Now each time we need some randomness we can call various helper functions:","Every time one of these functions is called, random_dec() will also be called somewhere in the stack, applying the deterministic arithmetic to the seed and returning a new random number."]},{"i":"i-heard-i-shouldnt-use-mathrandom-why-not","l":"I heard I shouldn't use Math.random(). Why not?","p":["When users mint each piece, they are creating a hash token on the blockchain. All the attributes of your piece should be derived from that token so that user will be able to render their piece and get the same results each time. Math.random is derived from the computer's clock, so there is no guarantee you will get the same output on different computing environments in the future."]},{"l":"Guidelines and Constraints","p":["Now you have the basics here are some general principles you need to consider when making your art."]},{"l":"Limited Dependencies","p":["a-frame","Additional libraries may be added at moderator discretion, but the rule is only one external library per project.","babylon.js","Canvas element provided by template (#babylon-canvas)","Each project can have zero or one library dependency.

More specifically, the initial output or frame must be the same. If your piece is animated, some randomness is okay. This is so when the art is rendered as an image (e.g. for OpenSea) it is always the same."]},{"l":"Dimensionless","p":["The output must be dimension agnostic. Meaning it scales seamlessly to any dimension. While you can control the dimension ratio (e.g. width/height can be 1.0, 1.5, 0.75 etc.) you have no control over the dimensions of the browser someone else might be using. The output will be rendered by the server at 2400x2400 (see below for ratios other than 1) and typically displayed in most browsers at 1000x1000 but your output should be the same at higher resolutions. Obviously, at lower resolutions, fewer pixels may limit what your output looks like, such as the smoothness of lines, which is okay. This is mainly to ensure your work can be reproduced at print quality.","A simple way to account for this is to define a default dimension and create a multiplier to scale coordinates or sizes relative to the canvas dimensions. Below uses p5js as an example but the same principle applies regardless of the language.","Before submitting your script, it's probably a good idea to test it in different resolutions and aspect ratios.","Set the hash to a constant value:","And then play with the browser window size, and refresh to check that your art looks the same at any resolution."]},{"l":"Cost","p":["Storing code on Ethereum is expensive! Taking average gas prices, you can generally expect to pay ~$10 for each full line of code your script requires. With that in mind - keep things efficient, maximize code reuse with functions, remove comments, and minify your finished code.","Based on previous projects, we've estimated the cost of uploading a script to be the following; where Bytes is the size of your project and gwei price is the price you set when submitting your transaction. It always helps to wait until non-peak hours to upload your script.","So a 10 KB project at 100 gwei would be:","Artists have recently targeted between ~5-20 KB for their code (without the library), but obviously this will vary by project scope."]},{"l":"Data Compression","p":["We allow artists to compress data stored within their scripts (e.g. SVG data); but in the case where the logic of the script itself is compressed to the point of obfuscating the auditing process we may ask that artists remove this level of compression."]},{"l":"Attribution","p":["Much (generative art) source code is published under permissive copyleft licenses, making it available to be used by everybody and depending on the license even for commercial purposes.

The price will then gradually decrease each block over the total auction time.","Automated exponential dutch auction: For exponential dutch auctions, artists specify the starting price, ending price, and the half-life for price drops. An easier way to determine this is to think of the total duration of the DA and then work backward to find the half-life at that total time. As an example, let's say that an exponential dutch auction was starting at 1 ETH and lowering to 0.1 ETH over 30 minutes. In this case, the half-life is 9 minutes meaning that over the course of every 9 minutes, the price would gradually be cut in half. So after 9 minutes, the DA will reach 0.5 and after 18 minutes, the DA will reach 0.25. The price drops within those half-life steps will gradually lower every block. You can use this calculator to find your auction’s half-life: https://www.calculator.net/half-life-calculator.html.

This price model should serve as a baseline for determining your project's size and price.","Projects are broken up into categories (first factory, factory return, playground, and curated) and each is assigned a maximum resting value that guides the selection of project size in relation to resting price. The maximum resting value is the total value that a project can generate at its resting price. This is calculated by multiplying the series size by the resting price. For Dutch auctions, the resting price is the final price tier of the auction sequence. For fixed price sales, the resting price is equivalent to the fixed price."]},{"l":"Project Pricing Model Explained","p":["The project categories are as follows:","First Factory = an artist's first factory project on Art Blocks","Factory Return = an artist's subsequent factory project","Playground = a Curated artist's subsequent project","Curated = a project released in our Curated Collection","Below is a table reference for total resting value assignable to each project type and category.","First Factory: 40 ETH | Factory Return: 60 ETH | Playground: 80 ETH | Curated: 100 ETH","When determining overall series size and mint price, think of a sliding scale. On one side, there is the series size and on the other side there is the resting price. The smaller your collection, the larger your resting price can be and vice versa. The charts below indicate the range of options you would have in series size and resting price for each category’s maximum resting value."]},{"i":"#","p":["Examples all with a maximum resting value of 60 ETH (Factory Return):","400 outputs sold via dutch auction tiers 1 > 0.5 > 0.35 > 0.22 > 0.15 (400 x 0.15 = 60)","250 outputs sold at a fixed price of 0.24 (250 x 0.24 = 60)","1000 outputs sold via dutch auction tiers 0.4 > 0.28 > 0.16 > 0.1 > 0.06 (1000 x 0.06 = 60)","Do note that this price structure does not affect the establishment of dutch auction starting price and tiers. Artists can design their dutch auction tiers as they'd like. Artists are also not limited to the series size options outlined in the above chart."]},{"l":"How To Use This Pricing Model","p":["The above category prices impose limits on project's overall resting value. That said, you are encouraged to also consider your audience and breadth of your project/mints when determining the best series size and price per token for your project.","Approaching price in terms of overall value leaves room for artists to ensure that their collection size and output pricing aligns with their created project. Keep in mind that if a collection uses a dutch auction sales mechanic, the collection may realize a greater value than the resting price. This pricing guidance does not limit the overall value a project may generate, it just requires that the project's resting value is not higher than these maximum prices. Conversely, artists are welcome to set prices and series sizes that fall below the specified maximum resting values. We recognize that the market is forever changing. Art Blocks will continue to monitor sales data and adjust these values as appropriate over time."]},{"l":"Price Reductions","p":["A project's pricing cannot be altered after release.

You can support any US-based 501c(3) charity in good standing with the IRS, or donate to any of several cause funds focused on a specific issue.","Donations through CryptoForCharity are set at the contract level and automatically routed at the time of payment without touching your wallet (and potentially avoiding tax liability or the need to account for and deduct the income/donation). Donated funds can also be held for a short time following your drop, if you'd prefer to designate the charity or cause fund you wish to support after the fact, but they cannot be held indefinitely.","Generating a charity or cause fund wallet is straightforward -- simply fill out the form here. You can also reach out directly to SimonSays#0670 in the AB discord for help.","For a bit more on how it's set up under the hood, CryptoForCharity put together this tax guidance for NFT creators.","4) Receive funds in your primary wallet","If you’d like to receive all funds from your project’s sale in your primary wallet, that’s fine, but please communicate the total donations with Art Blocks and the community. Please be aware that receiving money in your personal wallet may incur tax obligations and reduce the total donation amount.","3) Create a second wallet","If you’d like to create a second wallet separate from your personal wallet, you can enter the wallet's address in the additional payee field to collect the total donation amount you intend to donate.

Build relationships here that extend outside of the channel, and into other spaces, both AFK (away from the keyboard) and online. Tweeted about your upcoming release? Ask fellow AB artists to engage with your content. Collaborate on boosting each other’s visibility. Social media can be emotionally taxing, so use this channel as a space to build supportive and genuine relationships. On Tuesdays at 11 PM CT/12 PM ET, Art Blocks hosts Office Hours on Google Meet. This meeting is an open invitation to chat with other artists and the Art Blocks team face to face (or audio to audio).

With Art Blocks’ generative minting technology, collectors participate in the creation of the art. No one knows exactly what a piece will look like before it's minted, not even the artist. Each NFT is generated at the time of purchase using the buyer’s unique transaction hash to create a ‘1 of 1 of X’, which adds an extra layer of magic as the creator and collector watch a project come alive.","The interesting part of modern generative art is that it involves working in series - often a large series.

For an off-chain implimentation, partners can reference external off-chain assets using decentralized storage solutions like IPFS.","Decentralized and fully on-chain content is the most durable digital asset available. Typically, a creative coder writes a generative script in JavaScript and stores it directly on the blockchain. As long as you have access to a computer, a web browser, and Ethereum’s public ledger, you’ll always be able to reproduce the NFT in its original form and track ownership since creation. An on-chain NFT inherits the provenance, security, and durability of Ethereum itself, making them the highest quality digital asset available.","So, if Art Blocks ever shut down, all on-chain work would still be accessible since it's stored on the decentralized Ethereum blockchain and able to be viewed, bought, sold, and transferred without involving Art Blocks at all.","In contrast, if we store generative algorithms on an Art Blocks-owned database, the NFTs would rely on Art Blocks to return the assets - and if we go offline, the assets would not be retrievable. Similarly, if a script is stored on-chain but uses data from off-chain sources, it's vulnerable to the host of that off-chain data going offline.","Off-chain NFTs rely on assets stored on external servers. There are many reasons to reference off-chain assets - data storage is expensive on Ethereum, and using external assets can reduce the cost of putting data on-chain. It also allows for interesting applications of generative art using external assets. However, if your NFT references external sources and those sources go offline, the NFT will only track ownership of unretrievable data.","For this reason, we only allow certain external libraries to be used in project scripts given their general recognition as extremely reliable file storage sources.","Art Blocks Engine offers on-chain and off-chain solutions with our generative NFT minting technology.
