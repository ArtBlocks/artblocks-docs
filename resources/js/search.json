Our offerings allow the generative NFT minting technology used by artists at Art Blocks to be integrated with third-party sites.","Engine allows partners to release generative outputs using our existing smart contracts and rendering infrastructure resulting in turnkey and branded generative projects. Engine partners own their smart contracts and can use them to release as many projects as they like as often as they like.","We currently partner with organizations from every sector that are interested in launching generative collections, but are particularly interested in the fashion, sports, media, manufacturing, and fine art industries.","For more information on Art Blocks Engine partnerships please contact: info@artblocks.io"]},{"i":"what-is-the-difference-between-art-blocks-engine-and-engine-flex","l":"What is the difference between Art Blocks Engine and Engine Flex?","p":["Art Blocks Engine is our offering that aligns most closely with the Art Blocks flagship product ( https://artblocks.io), and has the same technical approach to on-chain art where artists store the entirety of their generative algorithms on-chain within the Engine smart contract and are limited to a single, widely-distributed, off-chain dependency (e.g. p5js).","With Art Blocks Engine Flex artists are able to include off-chain assets, stored on the decentralized storage solutions of IPFS or Arweave, as additional inputs into their creative coding practice. This allows, for example, a project that takes an image as an input and creates 1of1ofX outputs applying a generative practice to this input image. This final output combines a generative script, a token hash, and additional off-chain assets."]},{"i":"how-does-art-blocks-engine-flex-work","l":"How does Art Blocks Engine Flex work?","p":["With Art Blocks Engine Flex contracts, a per-project (as opposed to per-contract) field is available on all projects that allows an artist to set a single off-chain dependency or set of multiple off-chain dependencies based on the content ID locations where these dependencies are stored on IPFS or Arweave.","Currently, we do not yet support the turnkey ability to programically upload/pin these dependencies to IPFS/Arweave within the Engine experience directly; however, our team is more than happy to assist partners in the process of uploading/pinning assets on IPFS/Arweave using existing third party solutions for doing so (e.g. Pinata in the case of IPFS).","Note that for a single project, it is possible to have a single off-chain dependency (e.g. a single image file) or a set of off-chain dependencies (e.g. a series of images from a set). This means that is possible, for example, to have a project that creates 1of1ofX generative variants of a single base image asset, or one in which for a given token a random image is selected from the base image asset set, and then a generative process is applied to it.","It is also important to note that images are not the only supported external asset dependency type. It is possible to reference any file type that can be pinned/uploaded to IPFS or Arweave and intelligbly incorporated into a generative algorithm to create interesting artistic outputs. For example, a project could use tensorflow.js as its single-depedency, have its generative script be a tensorflow based creative coding algorithm, and store the model file for the machine learning model on IPFS or Arweave to support a ML/AI based project."]},{"i":"what-is-generative-art","l":"What is generative art?","p":["Generative art is about developing systems that define rules for creating art. By introducing randomness to those systems, core concepts are expressed through unique outputs. In a contemporary sense, this means writing computer algorithms to define the system and introduce randomness, which allows for conceptual exploration and rapid iteration.","Creative coders write scripts with specific parameters that introduce and explore features, which generate the final outputs in a collection. With Art Blocks’ generative minting technology, collectors participate in the creation of the art. No one knows exactly what a piece will look like before it's minted, not even the artist. Each NFT is generated at the time of purchase using the buyer’s unique transaction hash to create a ‘1 of 1 of X’, which adds an extra layer of magic as the creator and collector watch a project come alive.","The interesting part of modern generative art is that it involves working in series - often a large series. So instead of pursuing a single compelling work of art, a generative artist creates an algorithm capable of tens, hundreds, or thousands of compelling works of art. Which, when taken as a whole, expresses the range of possibilities contained in a single algorithm."]},{"i":"what-are-nfts","l":"What are NFTs?","p":["Nonfungible tokens (NFT) are unique digital assets stored on blockchain technology that can represent any digital or physical asset."]},{"l":"On-chain vs. off-chain","p":["Art Blocks Engine enables creators to immutably store their generative NFT directly on the Ethereum blockchain (on-chain) or reference an external library or asset (off-chain). For an off-chain implimentation, partners can reference external off-chain assets using decentralized storage solutions like IPFS.","Decentralized and fully on-chain content is the most durable digital asset available. Typically, a creative coder writes a generative script in JavaScript and stores it directly on the blockchain. As long as you have access to a computer, a web browser, and Ethereum’s public ledger, you’ll always be able to reproduce the NFT in its original form and track ownership since creation. An on-chain NFT inherits the provenance, security, and durability of Ethereum itself, making them the highest quality digital asset available.","So, if Art Blocks ever shut down, all on-chain work would still be accessible since it's stored on the decentralized Ethereum blockchain and able to be viewed, bought, sold, and transferred without involving Art Blocks at all.","In contrast, if we store generative algorithms on an Art Blocks-owned database, the NFTs would rely on Art Blocks to return the assets - and if we go offline, the assets would not be retrievable. Similarly, if a script is stored on-chain but uses data from off-chain sources, it's vulnerable to the host of that off-chain data going offline.","Off-chain NFTs rely on assets stored on external servers. There are many reasons to reference off-chain assets - data storage is expensive on Ethereum, and using external assets can reduce the cost of putting data on-chain. It also allows for interesting applications of generative art using external assets. However, if your NFT references external sources and those sources go offline, the NFT will only track ownership of unretrievable data.","For this reason, we only allow certain external libraries to be used in project scripts given their general recognition as extremely reliable file storage sources.","Art Blocks Engine offers on-chain and off-chain solutions with our generative NFT minting technology. Which one is right for you depends on your project’s goals and technical capabilities."]},{"l":"Creating durable digital assets","p":["Creating on-chain generative NFTs ensures your collectors can expect their digital assets to stay the same forever. But if you choose to launch a generative project with off-chain assets, there are ways to mitigate the risk of going off-line using technology like IPFS or Arweave. We’re happy to chat about the right Art Blocks Engine implementation for your next project."]},{"l":"Potential use-cases","p":["The landscape of on-demand generative content has plenty of room to experiment.

Specifically, the way this removal logic works is as follows: when an index to remove is passed in, the element at that index being removed is swapped with the element at the last index of the list of assets. Now that the last index holds the element to be removed, that element is removed off the list. This method, in addition to being more gas efficient, also ensures that our list/mapping does not have any \"holes\". The tradeoff, however, is that the removal causes the order of the external asset dependencies in this list to change, albeit in a deterministic manner: the element at the last index always moves to the removed index. This is important to keep in mind when writing your project script, though you can always update the ordering manually as you see fit by utilizing the updateProjectExternalAssetDependency() function.","You can view directly the full implementation of this removal function here: https://github.com/ArtBlocks/artblocks-contracts/blob/main/contracts/PBAB%2BCollabs/GenArt721CoreV2_ENGINE_FLEX.sol#L596"]},{"l":"Preferred Gateways","p":["The Engine Flex contract allows you to specify preferred gateways for the currently supported dependency types (IPFS & Arweave). Gateways are accessible HTTP interfaces and, when combined with an asset CID, expose urls for assets being stored on these off-chain decentralized platforms. These preferred gateways are updateable with a string param via the following functions: updateArweaveGateway()& updateIPFSGateway().","Please note that these preferred gateways are set per-contract, not per-project."]},{"l":"Working With External Asset Dependencies In Your Project Script","p":["When you request the live view for a given token of a project, the hash and tokenId of the token are provided in the tokenData object and the Art Blocks Generator injects this into the served HTML live view. This tokenData object has now been extended with the following external asset dependency related data, if it is available:","Your project script can then easily make use of these dependencies by combining the CID of the asset with the appropriate gateway. As a simple example: If you have an external asset dependency with a CID QmXxgX5Qyhqz1t9wDFkvJtjVKYe1f8Uj714RV2n1LS76Pg and a dependencyType of IPFS, you can construct the full url of your external asset depdency by combining the preferredIPFSGateway, which let's assume is https://ipfs.io/ipfs/, with the asset CID. This gives you the full url of the asset, https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXxgX5Qyhqz1t9wDFkvJtjVKYe1f8Uj714RV2n1LS76Pg, and allows your project script to download it with fetch and use it as it sees fit.","Note that if your CID is pointing to a directory of assets, rather than a single asset, your project script will need to be aware of the file naming structure of this directory to fetch the assets individually. Using the previous example, imagine that CID QmXxgX5Qyhqz1t9wDFkvJtjVKYe1f8Uj714RV2n1LS76Pg was pointing to a directory of 10 PNG images, with filenames corresponding to the numbers 1-10. Your project script would generate the same full url with the information provided, https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXxgX5Qyhqz1t9wDFkvJtjVKYe1f8Uj714RV2n1LS76Pg, but also append the specific file you want to fetch by being aware of the naming conventions, ie https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXxgX5Qyhqz1t9wDFkvJtjVKYe1f8Uj714RV2n1LS76Pg/1.png."]},{"l":"Loading JS Libraries As External Asset Dependencies","p":["If you are specifically looking to utilize an external asset dependency as a JavaScript library in your project script, you cannot simply add it as a script element onto the page.

Specifically, static images are rendered for all projects (used as thumbnails, on other platforms, etc.). To generate these, Art Blocks currently uses compute instances running headless Chromium with Puppeteer. Headless Chromium requires the use of SwiftShader, a CPU implementation of the GPU API.

A generative script (using p5js for example) is stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain for each project. When a user wants to purchase an iteration of a project hosted on the platform, they purchase an ERC721 compliant \"non-fungible\" token, also stored on the Ethereum blockchain, containing a provably unique \"seed\" which controls variables in the generative script. These variables, in turn, control the way the output looks and operates.","Each \"seed\", also known as a \"hash string\" is a hexadecimal string generated in a pseudo-random manner at the time the token is minted.

The output will be rendered by the server at 2400x2400 (see below for ratios other than 1) and typically displayed in most browsers at 1000x1000 but your output should be the same at higher resolutions. Obviously, at lower resolutions, fewer pixels may limit what your output looks like, such as the smoothness of lines, which is okay. This is mainly to ensure your work can be reproduced at print quality.","A simple way to account for this is to define a default dimension and create a multiplier to scale coordinates or sizes relative to the canvas dimensions.
