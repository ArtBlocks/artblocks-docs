[[{"i":"welcome-to-the-art-blocks-docs","l":"Welcome to the Art Blocks Docs!","p":["This documentation seeks to provide guidance for 3 primary audiences:","artists/creators preparing their projects to launch on Art Blocks or a Powered by Art Blocks (PBAB) platform","current and prospective PBAB partners","integrators/aggregators/marketplaces etc., looking to integrate with the Art Blocks APIs","You will find the three main sections in our documentation mirrors these three primary audiences. Please explore the docs here, and let us know if you have any questions.","For any issues with the docs, please file a bug here, or send us a PR with a suggested change!"]}],[{"l":"Art Blocks 101 for Creators","p":["A guide on getting started as a creator with Art Blocks.","The primary audience for this document is artists who have already entered the pipeline for launching a project on Art Blocks. If you are an artist currently waiting in the applications queue or applying to Art Blocks, this documentation will provide a helpful guide for you in terms of what to expect, but many of the steps here will not be actionable for you until you have had a project shell set up by the Art Blocks team.","Artists will likely need to tweak/optimize their project code to get it working in the Art Blocks environment. Specifically, static images are rendered for all projects (used as thumbnails, on other platforms, etc.). To generate these, Art Blocks currently uses compute instances running headless Chromium with Puppeteer. Headless Chromium requires the use of SwiftShader, a CPU implementation of the GPU API. This means GPU intensive projects will render slower and may require code optimization and performance improvements from the artist. To closely replicate this environment on your end while developing, we recommend using Chrome and turning off\"Use Hardware Acceleration\" in Settings."]},{"l":"Documentation","p":["The Art Blocks platform hosts generative projects for the production of verifiably deterministic outputs. A generative script (using p5js for example) is stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain for each project. When a user wants to purchase an iteration of a project hosted on the platform, they purchase an ERC721 compliant \"non-fungible\" token, also stored on the Ethereum blockchain, containing a provably unique \"seed\" which controls variables in the generative script. These variables, in turn, control the way the output looks and operates.","Each \"seed\", also known as a \"hash string\" is a hexadecimal string generated in a pseudo-random manner at the time the token is minted. Each character (0-9, a-f) represents a value from 0-15 and each pair of characters (\"aa\", or \"f2\") represents a value from 0-255.","For example:","This hash will be the source of entropy or variation use to determine the output of your algorithm. When your art is rendered on Art Blocks, your script will have access to a global variable called tokenData. One of the first lines in your script should be to read in the hash from this variable.","Included in the tokenData is also the tokenId. The tokenId encodes both the project and mint.","If your script needs to know the mint number or project number, it can do so like this:","When you are testing locally, this variable obviously will not be defined in your browser environment. This here is a simple function to generate valid hashes and tokenIds."]},{"l":"Safely deriving randomness from the token hash","p":["Art Blocks strongly recommends that all artists use an instance of the following Random class to feed all of their project's randomness.","Note that the class uses the prng algorithm sfc32, which was designed and coded by Chris Doty-Humphry and is public domain. More information can be found at http://pracrand.sourceforge.net.","The convenience methods random_num, random_int, random_bool, and random_choice may be removed if not needed for a specific project. Artists may also add their own convenience methods, but all randomness should be originally sourced from the random_dec() function.","We can get an instance of the Random class like so:","Now each time we need some randomness we can call various helper functions:","Every time one of these functions is called, random_dec() will also be called somewhere in the stack, applying the deterministic arithmetic to the seed and returning a new random number."]},{"i":"i-heard-i-shouldnt-use-mathrandom-why-not","l":"I heard I shouldn't use Math.random(). Why not?","p":["When users mint each piece, they are creating a hash token on the blockchain. All the attributes of your piece should be derived from that token so that user will be able to render their piece and get the same results each time. Math.random is derived from the computer's clock, so there is no guarantee you will get the same output on different computing environments in the future."]},{"l":"Guidelines and Constraints","p":["Now you have the basics here are some general principles you need to consider when making your art."]},{"l":"Limited Dependencies","p":["a-frame","Additional libraries may be added at moderator discretion, but the rule is only one external library per project.","Each project can have zero or one library dependency. The approved dependencies are currently the following:","http://paperjs.org","https://aframe.io","https://github.com/metafizzy/zdog","https://p5js.org","https://processing.org","https://threejs.org","https://tonejs.github.io","Library","megavox","No Library at all","p5.js","paper.js","processing.js","r124","regl","Source","svg","three.js","tone.js","v0.12.15","v1.0.0","v1.1.0-beta","v1.1.2","v1.2.0","v1.4.6","v14.8.15","v2.1.0","Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, WebGL","Version","vox","Zdog"]},{"l":"Deterministic","p":["Each output must be deterministic based on a single hash. More specifically, the initial output or frame must be the same. If your piece is animated, some randomness is okay. This is so when the art is rendered as an image (e.g. for OpenSea) it is always the same."]},{"l":"Dimensionless","p":["The output must be dimension agnostic. Meaning it scales seamlessly to any dimension. While you can control the dimension ratio (e.g. width/height can be 1.0, 1.5, 0.75 etc.) you have no control over the dimensions of the browser someone else might be using. The output will be rendered by the server at 2400x2400 (see below for ratios other than 1) and typically displayed in most browsers at 1000x1000 but your output should be the same at higher resolutions. Obviously, at lower resolutions, fewer pixels may limit what your output looks like, such as the smoothness of lines, which is okay. This is mainly to ensure your work can be reproduced at print quality.","A simple way to account for this is to define a default dimension and create a multiplier to scale coordinates or sizes relative to the canvas dimensions. Below uses p5js as an example but the same principle applies regardless of the language.","Before submitting your script, it's probably a good idea to test it in different resolutions and aspect ratios.","Set the hash to a constant value:","And then play with the browser window size, and refresh to check that your art looks the same at any resolution."]},{"l":"Cost","p":["Storing code on Ethereum is expensive! Taking average gas prices, you can generally expect to pay ~$10 for each full line of code your script requires. With that in mind - keep things efficient, maximize code reuse with functions, remove comments, and minify your finished code.","Based on previous projects, we've estimated the cost of uploading a script to be the following; where Bytes is the size of your project and gwei price is the price you set when submitting your transaction. It always helps to wait until non-peak hours to upload your script.","So a 10 KB project at 100 gwei would be:","Artists have recently targeted between ~5-20 KB for their code (without the library), but obviously this will vary by project scope."]},{"l":"Attribution","p":["Much (generative art) source code is published under permissive copyleft licenses, making it available to be used by everybody and depending on the license even for commercial purposes. In case your project's code contains any code not written by yourself, please inform the Art Blocks team about it so the appropriate considerations and attributions can be made.","Common source code licenses (in creative coding):","CC BY: The original author and license must be clearly and appropriately stated.","CC BY-SA: As CC BY, but all derivates must also be licensed under CC BY-SA.","CC BY-NC-SA: As CC BY-SA, but no commercial use is allowed.","MIT: similar to CC BY","GPL: similar to CC BY-SA","There are many other free-to-use licenses commonly used on open source software. Please carefully read the full details on any licensed code you re-use or modify, before including it in your project."]},{"l":"Testing on Ropsten","p":["Once your application is approved and your script is ready, you will test it out on an Art Blocks staging site running on one of Ethereum's test networks (Ropsten). This will make sure there aren't any bugs or errors and that if it's working on Ropsten, it will work on Mainnet. You can connect to this site by changing the network in your browser wallet (e.g. the very top button of MetaMask). You'll still be using the same wallet and address, except on the test network.","Note: If you don't have \"Ropsten ETH\" ask a mod or previous artist, we'll send you some to play with. Or if you don't feel like waiting, request some from the faucet: https://faucet.dimensions.network/."]},{"l":"Interacting with your Project","p":["If you made it this far, we have probably requested a project name and an Ethereum address from you. If not, that probably means your an artist who is in our pipeline and pending being onboardedâ€“once we get you processed the following instructions will make more sense!","If you have provided a project name and Ethereum address to our team, this address you provided to our team will be used on mainnet and on Ropsten. So at this point change your network to Ropsten in MetaMask. On Ropsten, we'll practice uploading everything so that it all goes smooth on mainnet when the ETH is real. After loading the page and connecting your wallet, you should see a button labeled \"Edit Project\". A multi-tabbed form will pop up. You only need to focus on the following:"]},{"l":"Project","p":["This should all be self-explanatory. Just fill and submit each one separately."]},{"l":"Token","p":["In this tab you'll set the price and max invocations for your project. If you're accepting ETH as payment you don't need to worry about \"Updated Currency Information\" and should not change the currency address. To reiterate, do not update the currency address to be your wallet addressâ€“this field should only be set if you are accepting payment for your project in some non-ETH ERC20-compliant token.","You can though specify any ERC20-compliant token if you choose, just give someone on the Art Blocks team a heads up that you wish to go down this route.","Set the baseURI: https://api.artblocks.io/token/"]},{"l":"Script","p":["Here you'll first specify the dependency of your project including the script type and the version number of that dependency. For most scripts, you can leave the version blank or enter 1. The aspect ratio is a single number. E.g. 1 or 0.75 etc. If your piece takes a certain amount of time to fully render you can type in the render delay to let the server know when to render the canvas.","Once you've submitted your script details add your script to the \"Project Scripts\" box. Remember, tokenData.hash is a global variable in the environment this script will live in, so you do not need to define tokenData in your script, just expect your script will have access to it.","If your script is big, consider minifying it. If your script is so big that you cannot fit it in a single transaction (you're getting an error when you submit), you may need to split it up and submit each part subsequently."]},{"l":"Splitting","p":["Once you have a working minified version of your project, a recommended way of splitting the file in parts for upload is to use the \"split\" command in Unix systems (Linux, Mac), like this:","That will create an evenly distributed set of files with the splitted code, automatically. The maximum size you can upload to Artblocks per transaction is around 10.5KB (you can center that as -b 10500 in the split tool, since it does not take decimals)","if you are on Windows, you can use the same command if you have git bash, or a tool like 7-Zip, which allows you to split without compression."]},{"l":"Finishing Actions","p":["Once all of the necessary fields have been submitted, you can then click \"Purchases Paused\" to test out the minting. Once your test mints are working in the livescript view, mint 20-40.","Make sure you've tested your code on multiple browsers (Chrome / Firefox / Safari) and on multiple device types (desktop / mobile) to ensure consistent output."]},{"i":"how-does-my-project-get-those-opensea-attributes","l":"How does my project get those OpenSea attributes?","p":["Once your project is selected to be included in one of the Art Blocks collections, the onboarding team will help you with this. The one thing to keep in mind is that all of the attributes you want displayed should be directly generated from the transaction hash and should not depend on any other randomness.","This script is essentially a copy of your rendering script but without any dependencies present (the server won't have access to them).","For full details on how to structure your project features, please see Art Blocks Features Script."]}],[{"l":"Artist Onboarding Steps","p":["Below you'll find an overview of each step of our onboarding process as well as an estimated time required for each step."]},{"l":"1.

You are not required or even encouraged to consume the project category's entire total value. Consider your audience and the breadth of your project/mints and decide whatâ€™s best for you. This price model should serve as a baseline for determining your project's size and price.","Projects are broken up into categories (first factory, factory return, playground, and curated) and each is assigned a maximum resting value that guides the selection of project size in relation to resting price. The maximum resting value is the total value that a project can generate at its resting price. This is calculated by multiplying the series size by the resting price. For Dutch auctions, the resting price is the final price tier of the auction sequence. For fixed price sales, the resting price is equivalent to the fixed price."]},{"l":"Project Pricing Model Explained","p":["The project categories are as follows:","First Factory = an artist's first factory project on Art Blocks","Factory Return = an artist's subsequent factory project","Playground = a Curated artist's subsequent project","Curated = a project released in our Curated Collection","Below is a table reference for total resting value assignable to each project type and category.","First Factory: 40 ETH | Factory Return: 60 ETH | Playground: 80 ETH | Curated: 100 ETH","When determining overall series size and mint price, think of a sliding scale. On one side, there is the series size and on the other side there is the resting price. The smaller your collection, the larger your resting price can be and vice versa.

Artists can design their dutch auction tiers as they'd like. Artists are also not limited to the series size options outlined in the above chart."]},{"l":"How To Use This Pricing Model","p":["The above category prices impose limits on project's overall resting value. That said, you are encouraged to also consider your audience and breadth of your project/mints when determining the best series size and price per token for your project. Keep in mind there is a two month cooldown period after a release is complete before you can deploy another project.","Approaching price in terms of overall value leaves room for artists to ensure that their collection size and output pricing aligns with their created project. Keep in mind that if a collection uses a dutch auction sales mechanic, the collection may realize a greater value than the resting price. This pricing guidance does not limit the overall value a project may generate, it just requires that the project's resting value is not higher than these maximum prices. Conversely, artists are welcome to set prices and series sizes that fall below the specified maximum resting values. We recognize that the market is forever changing.
