# Launch Prep 101
A successful marketing campaign will help new Engine partners connect and grow with their audience. Crypto markets are volatile, and sales are not guaranteed. One way Engine partners achieve sustainable success can be to build an active and engaged audience. 

## Project pricing
Balancing your initial pricing model can be complex, and your team should consider market conditions in your decision. Thankfully, Art Blocks Engine partners can use the tools in our Minter Suite for a nuanced launch approach. Our Minter Suite has drop mechanisms, including flat price, linear dutch auction, exponential dutch auction, custom erc20 tokens, and an allowlist. 

It’s also important to consider your primary audience. Are they crypto-native and follow every generative project? Are they retail visitors that may be buying their first generative output? Are you creating a bespoke experience that commands a premium? 

For oversubscribed projects that will have a lot of attention, we usually recommend a Dutch Auction mechanic to allow for price discovery on primary sales before settling at a resting price. But, if you want to reward your established community with early access, maybe an allowlist is right for you. 

Given our vantage point in the industry, we’re happy to connect and chat through the implications of different pricing models. 

## Pre-launch mints
It’s tradition for an artist to keep mint #0 from a new project. You can also pre-mint a few tokens for private buyers, specific community members, or for promotional use. But you should be open and honest if you plan to mint pieces before they’re publicly available.  

It’s important to note that if an artist or platform mints pieces from their collection, the mint price should be set to the anticipated sales price or the resting price from a Dutch Auction. 

## Cross promotion
The Art Blocks Twitter accounts will amplify Engine partner’s communications at the discretion of the Art Blocks team. Partner’s communication requests will default to [Art Blocks Engine’s Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ArtBlocksEngine). But, we’re proud of our partners' work, and occasionally, our [Flagship account](https://twitter.com/artblocks_io) will amplify messages that align with our brand identity and use generative minting technology in new and interesting ways. 

It’s important to note that brands should not rely on the Art Blocks collector base as the primary audience for new platform launches, and we encourage your team to strategize ways to increase the reach of generative content into new collector markets. 

## Brand Assets
Partners are only permitted to use approved brand assets (provided by Art Blocks) on their website and promotional materials. Please reach out if you have any questions.

# Marketing Tools for Engine Partners
Art Blocks carefully selects our partners based on platforms, ideas, and people we believe in. 
One benefit of releasing as an Art Blocks Engine partner is that you are now entering a vibrant ecosystem of generative enthusiasts. Our main advice for promoting your new platform is to build and foster your community. 

### Discord
Discord is a messaging platform made for online communities (think: Slack for everyone). It’s one of the primary ways Art Blocks interfaces with our community. Discord allows you to have a moderation team, set up public and private channels, host events, and much more. We highly recommend setting up a Discord server with some basic rules for conduct and channels relevant to your project. 

Art Blocks also has a list of Discord bots + tools we use in our server, and we’d be happy to share those tools with our partners. Contact your account manager if you’re interested in the tools Art Blocks uses. 

### Twitter
Twitter is a great place to promote your project. Our main piece of advice is to participate! Tweet, reply, and share works in progress. Engage with those who comment on your posts. Follow other generative artists, collectors, and Web3 thought-leaders. Alongside Discord, this is where you start conversations and find your audience. Sharing your work is equally as important as participating in conversations.

Other Tips

Have a virtual hype man? Gift them with a token! Show appreciation to your fans.
Create additional materials that frame and give context to your upcoming platform. This can be done through good storytelling, Youtube videos, article, etc.

## Vibecheck
Art Blocks Engine partners benefit from AB’s growing pains as a pioneer in the industry. From our vantage point, we can highlight mistakes we’ve previously made and help your team avoid those challenges. 

If you’re planning a unique drop mechanic, distribution mechanism, giveaway, or anything aside from a straightforward project release, you can always connect with the Art Blocks team to get our perspective on how the project may be publicly received. Reach out to your account manager to schedule a brainstorming session.
